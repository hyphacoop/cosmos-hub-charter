# Preamble: 
"[The Cosmos Hub] is a network of [ATOM holders] who share common purpose, and are the only ones who hold the power to execute actions that manage [the Hub's] shared resources." ([Anticapture](https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/f6bZ6cPxJpP-4K_NB7JcjbU0XblJcaf7kVLD75dOYRQ))

# The Interchain: 
- The Interchain is a network of state-machines connected by the Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol (IBC).
- IBC is a shared Interchain resource that was funded by the Cosmos Hub. 

# The Cosmos Hub: 
- The Cosmos Hub is a key economic, meta-political, and coordination zone in the Interchain that is composed of ATOM holders. ([Cosmos Hub Charter](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/discussion-working-draft-of-cosmos-hub-charter/7803) and [Community Charter Review](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ay8AdBq6fZ8muQ093p-YfwvtPLH5TV8bJXOfi-LKwbI/edit#))
- Anyone that owns any piece of an ATOM token is an ATOM holder. 
- ATOM holders may become citizens by staking ATOM.
- Citizens dictate the allocation of the Cosmos Hub shared resources via governance. 

# Governance: 
- Governance includes every action related to influencing the shared resources of the Cosmos Hub.

## On-chain Governance:
- Cosmos Hub citizens use on-chain governance to reach consensus about governance decisions.
- The on-chain governance process is determined via the binary run by Cosmos Hub validators that collectively have >66% of total staked tokens delegated to them. 
- Cosmos citizens can alter on-chain governance processes via a software-upgrade proposal or a gov-param proposal. 
- On-chain governance is the outcome of off-chain governance. 

## Off-chain Governance: 
- Off-chain governance recursively encompasses every aspect of decision making that does not happen on-chain.
- Off-chain governance processes may arise at any time with or without social consensus.
- Off-chain processes cannot be strictly enforced and are constantly in flux. 
- Off-chain governance processes may be ratified via an on-chain proposal called a signaling proposal.
- When possible, ratified processes should seek expression via on-chain governance. If not, governance processes are expected to be upheld via social norms and consensus.
